# LAB 3 - Hive

Hi everyone! I hope the semester is going good. We all had a tough time setting up hadoop on our systems and to make your lives easier, your lab 3 will be perfomred on GCP! Hurray! Now you will appreciate pre setup cloud instances
better. 

This lab we will be working on Hive and will be executing few Hive queries. Your next assignments will be on spark and this would be a pre-requisite.

Please find the document in the repo that has all the instructions specified to do your lab assignment. You should be able to complete it by yourselves with the help of the document.

Happy learning!
